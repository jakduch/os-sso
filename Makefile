# php${PLUGIN_PHP}-*, never a hardcoded major: OPNsense 25.7/26.1 are FreeBSD 14 with
# php83, 26.7 is FreeBSD 15 with php85, and a package naming php83-curl on 26.7 refuses
# to install at all ("Missing dependency 'php83-curl'"). Mk/defaults.mk derives
# PLUGIN_PHP from the php binary on the build host; the release workflow has no php in
# its build VM and passes it per ABI on the make command line instead.
