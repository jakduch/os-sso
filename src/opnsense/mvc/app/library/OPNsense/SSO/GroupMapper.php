 *
 * Mapping strategy (additive, conservative):
 *   - defaultGroups are always granted.
 *   - each asserted IdP group is run through an explicit name->name map if the
 *     provider supplied one, otherwise matched 1:1 by (case-insensitive) name.
 *   - only OPNsense groups that actually exist are touched; unknown names are
 *     ignored (a typo in the IdP must never silently grant nothing-or-everything).
 *
 * Membership is additive by default: we add the user to resolved groups but do
 * not strip memberships we did not assert. Optional strict reconciliation
 * (deprovision-on-login) removes memberships the IdP no longer asserts -- but only
 * ones os-sso itself granted (tracked in a per-user provenance stamp), never a
 * hand-assigned local group, and never the last member of a privileged group.
