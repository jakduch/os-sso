/**
 * The single OpenVPN web-auth setting becomes the first of a list of profiles.
 *
 * A firewall runs more than one OpenVPN instance often enough that one global provider,
 * host and timeout was the wrong shape. The old node is read straight from config.xml --
 * the model no longer describes those fields, so the model cannot see them -- and lands
 * as a profile named "default", which is also the profile a server that passes no
 * argument to the script gets. So an upgrade keeps working with nothing to re-enter.
