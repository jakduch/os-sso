# OpenVPN deferred web-auth with a REAL client, driven from the host.
#
# test/e2e/vpn.sh exercises the two scripts in isolation; this one puts an actual
# OpenVPN client in front of them: connect, get deferred, complete the SSO login in
# the "browser", and check the tunnel comes up.
#
# The client runs with `dev null` because bringing up a tun device needs root and the
# tunnel payload is not what is under test -- the authentication handshake is.
#
# Prerequisites: `openvpn` on the host, the lab VPN server started in the VM
#   (vagrant ssh -c 'sudo sh /home/vagrant/os-sso/test/vagrant/setup-vpn-server.sh'),
# and vpn.conf pointing at a working provider (System > Access > SSO VPN web-auth).
#
# Usage: SSO_GUI_PORT=8444 ./vpn-client.sh
